# Chatbot Web App

This project contains a simple web application for a chatbot built with Node.js.
The interface includes a dark mode toggle, message timestamps and persistent chat
history stored in your browser.

## Requirements
- Node.js 18 or later (uses built-in `http` module, no external dependencies)

## Running the App

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your browser to interact with the chatbot.

The server responds with a few helpful prompts. Try asking for the current time or date!
